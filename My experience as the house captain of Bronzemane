There are four houses in my school, Bronzemane, Silvermont, Copperquil and Ironscale. Since I was selected as the house captain of Bronzemane, there’s looaaaads of stuff left to be done.

I encountered a problem in the first week after I was selected as the house captain. During a speech on house disciplines, half of the students sitting under were checking which house they belong to, while the other half is asking “what is this house?”. Clearly, I was the only person in the room that had full awareness of the house principles. But without the support and participation of my fellow classmates, can any house activities be carried out???

I wandered in the corridor, searching for the answer in my head, eyes flipping on the club posters. It seems to be impossible. For no reason at all, the animation club’s poster caught my eyes and an idea popped up: Teenagers nowadays are all crazy about original characters(OC), treating their precious figures like their babies. So, what if I create a OC for Bronzemane? If members can express their houses not by the rules of teachers, but in their own unique way, will they participate more?

Immediately, I called my friend who is in also in Bronzemane and told her about my idea. She was fascinated. We spend a whole night drawing and editing, yawning our heads off. Luckily, our hard work paid off. At dawn, Bronzemane’s first OC came into view : A dark-green-hair girl in crown.She holds a sword in one hand and a shield in the other. The next day, the vice captain and I spent the whole day promoting. Although nobody had clues about where things would go, we had the instinct feeling that it would be a great success.  And it surely iiiiisssss!!!!! After the first OC design, designing house OC has become the TOP 3 in the “popularity trend list”. Every time after, when mentioning house activities, no one looked puzzled. Instead, they listened carefully with pride burning in their eyes.
